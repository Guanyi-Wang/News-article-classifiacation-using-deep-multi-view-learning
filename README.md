# Abstract  
While the topic of news article classification has attracted more attention due to the appearance of large news article datasets, only few of these datasets contain rich content of meta data like ION dataset. Therefore, this paper focuses on building up a multi-view model using three features (headlines, news content and images) from ION dataset. However, it's challenging to perform multi-label classification on this dataset since no researchers have done this before and the label space of ION dataset is extremely large. For purpose of completing multi-view model research, this paper does experiments on each single view firstly.  When it comes to text view, in order to solve the vanishing gradient problem while training Convolutional Long Short Term Memory Network (C-LSTM) model on long sequence datasets, this paper proposes a novel Dynamic Max-pooling C-LSTM (DMC-LSTM) model which utilizes a dynamic max-pooling layer to reduce window features without abandoning sequential information. This model is then evaluated on benchmark dataset(RCV-1) and news content of ION dataset and the results show that this model outperforms all the other CNN based deep models. Finally, a multi-view model is built by combining three best models in each view using Multi-Entry Neural Network(MENET) to perform the multi-view news article classification task, and the result also outperforms substantially than results in single view.
